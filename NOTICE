6. README.md
   - Added CryptoTensors introduction and features
   - Added citation to the research paper: "CryptoTensors: A Light-Weight Large 
     Language Model File Format for Highly-Secure Model Distribution" (Zhu et al., 2025)
   - Added usage examples for encryption and signing

7. docs/source/index.mdx
   - Added CryptoTensors Extension section
   - Added research foundation citation
   - Documented CryptoTensors features and capabilities
